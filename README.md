Apache PySpark is an open-source distributed computing framework, extending Apache Spark’s 
capabilities to Python. Developed at UC Berkeley’s AMP Lab, PySpark supports complex data 
operations, including SQL queries, data streaming, machine learning, and graph processing. It is widely 
used in industries such as telecommunications and finance for real-time data processing and analytics 
on large-scale datasets.
